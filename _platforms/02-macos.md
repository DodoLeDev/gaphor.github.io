*Note*: Sometimes launching the app the first time after installation fails due
to macOS security settings, please attempt to launch it a 2nd time if this
happens. Right click (Ctrl+click) on the icon to bring up the context menu and
open it from there.

*Note*: On macOS Mojave and later, you'll have to grant permission to run Gaphor via the System preferences
panel.  For further assistance, see [Apple support](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
