If you have the latest stable version of Python installed and the Gaphor
dependencies installed, you can also install Gaphor using a wheel from PyPI.

If you don't have the latest stable version of Python and the Gaphor dependencies
installed, follow the development environment [setup instructions](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/blob/master/README.md#development)
section and instead of cloning the repository, create a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments),
and then execute the following:

```bash
$ pip install gaphor
$ gaphor
```
