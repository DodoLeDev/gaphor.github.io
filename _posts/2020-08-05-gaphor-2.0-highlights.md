With Gaphor 2.0 we finally got some big new features in. Those features were long time
in the making, since most of the development work got Gaphor 1.2 lay the groundwork
for the changes we wanted to implement for 2.0.

With [49 Pull requests](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed++milestone%3A2.0.0) on GitHub this is by far the biggest release we've done so far.

So, what am I excited about you ask? Well, how about:

* SysML support
* Customizable style
* Copy/paste functionality
* New application logo


## SysML support

By introducing SysML gaphor now has (basic) support for systems engineering. This new modeling language has been added as a module to the application,
therefore it's also possible to add other modeling languages, either as part of Gaphor or as separately distributed plugins.

## Customizable style

So far, all diagrams in Gaphor are black-and-white. But now anymore. We added a simple CSS styling engine that allow you to add some color to the diagrams. There are some powerful combinations. You can find some more examples in the [technical documentation](https://gaphor.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/style_sheets.html)

I may have overdone it for the screenshot, but you get the idea, right?

## Copy/paste functionality

Copy/paste functionality has been part of Gaphor for some time. However, it only worked if you really just did a copy and paste (and not removed some items in between). How the copying and pasting has been made a lot more robust. It's basically making an internal copt of the diagram item *and* the
underlaying model element. In an upcoming version you should be able to copy/paste between diagrams as well.

## New application logo

It's 2020 and the old logo dated back from the early 2000's. So it was about time for a new, fresh logo.

_Old and new logo, side by side._

We hope you'll enjoy using Gaphor as much as we do building it. [Give it a try]({% link download.html %}) and let us know what you think.
