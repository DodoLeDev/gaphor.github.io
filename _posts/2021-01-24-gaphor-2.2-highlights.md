With Gaphor 2.2 we've set a new milestone when it comes to user-friendliness, both for the installation process (signed builds on Windows and macOS) and during use (simplified relationships).

The Gaphor logo has had a big update during the 2.2 development cycle.

## Signed builds for Windows and macOS

Both Windows and macOS builds are now signed. This means that Windows and macOS will not complain about you running Gaphor anymore. Although Gaphor 2.1 was already signed on Windows, we never emphasised it.

The signed builds makes installing and running Gaphor easier. If you wan to support Gaphor on Windows and macOS, check out [Dan's sponsor page on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/danyeaw). Developer licenses, required for signing, require an anual subscription.

## Instant feedback

From the feedback we recieved on Gaphor 2.0,

it's hard to figure out how to create a valid relationship. In Gaphor 2.2, we made a big step to solve this issue once and for all.

This short video shows you how it works:

<video controls width="80%">

</video>

Items are highlighted when a relationship can start on that point, and will highlight when you can drop the relationship.

When no relation can be made, the item will gray out. You can see that both
ends of an inheritance relationship can not point to the same class.

This guidance makes it easier to spot which elements can be connected. There's no need to connect exactly on an edge anymore. I'm using a trackpad and I wonder how I could have lived without this functionality for so long. It makes modeling so much easier!


## New logo

Thanks to GNOME UX designed Tobias Bernard, we have a new logo. Although we dusted off the logo for te 2.0 release, with the new logo we hope to make clear what the intention of Gaphor is. We think it nicely strikes a balance between simplicity and complexity, expressing Gaphor's intent to suite both casual and MBSE modeling needs.

## Under the hood

To support the usability features we had to give Gaphas, the library that powers the diagram editing, a major upgrade. As a result diagram items now internally behave a lot more like model elements. This allowed us to simplify the copy-and-paste code.

Apart from that all edit actions are now guaranteed to run inside a "undo" transaction. Transactions are what powers the undo system in Gaphor. When errors occur, a transaction is rolled back. This avoids the data model from ending up in an invalid state.
