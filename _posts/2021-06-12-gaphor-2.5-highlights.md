I missed out updating you on what's new in 2.3 and 2.4. Let's make it up for 2.5 :).

Gaphor 2.3 in itself was quite abig release: we added Fault Tree Analysis (RAAML) and C4 model support.

In Gaphor 2.4 support for DataType, ValueType, Primitive, and Enumeration were added to the SysML language.
On the UI the window state is restored when a model is opened again. This means that the diagrams that were opened the last time you viewed the diagram will be restored.
Lastly we started support for Gaphor 2.4.

In Gaphor 2.5 more functionality has been added to the Risk Assessment and Modeling Language (RAAML).

## Risk Analysis and Assessment Modeling Language

<TODO: explain RAAML>

<TODO: illustrative image of a RAAML/FTA model>

## Internal improvements

Finally, in Gaphro 2.5 items on a diagram, so called `Presentation` elements, are treated equally to elements that make up the symantic model (e.g. Classes, Associations). This is a simplication in the way Gaphor has to deal with models. We expect that this will add to the stability of Gaphor.
