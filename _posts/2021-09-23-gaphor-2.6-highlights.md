With Gaphor 2.6 we improved "under the hood". We improved on the saving/loading stability. Added multiple translations and improved the Windows version of Gaphor.

## Model stability

Over the past months we received a couple of issues where users where not able to open a model after saving it. Although the main fixes have been done in [Gaphor 2.5](/2021/07/02/gaphor-2.5-highlights.html), some extra work needed to be done. With Gaphor 2.6 we expect we reached the stability.

## Translations

With help of [ovari](https://github.com/ovari) we started using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gaphor/gaphor/) to manage translations for Gaphor. As a result Gaphor's speaks native Finnish, Galician, Hungarian, and Korean. The Spanish translation got an update.

## Windows build more native

The Windows build has become more native as well. Previously we used MSYS as the basis for our Windows distribution. The downside was that the (patched) Python version distributed with MSYS tried to behave like a Unix version in a Windows world. Now we're using the Windows Python and GTK compiled for the windows platform.

## 2.6.1

Out first patch release in the 2.6 series (to be released) contains many small fixes, from unintentionally rotating Join bars to name and icon updates. 

Many thanks go to [Zsolt Sandor](https://github.com/sz332) for bringing our attention to many of the small glitches in Gaphor.
His thorough QA found a fair amount issues, of which most of them are fixed in 2.6.1.

With those fixes in, we can confidently state that 2.6.1 will be the best release so far. At least until 2.7 is released ;).
