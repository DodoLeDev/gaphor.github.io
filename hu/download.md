There are many ways to install Gaphor. The simplest is to download the
official installer for Windows or macOS. For Linux you can install Gaphor
using FlatHub.  You can also use Python's built-in `pip` tool as long as you
have all of the required dependencies installed.

If you're a developer, you can find the source code [on
GitHub](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor).
