{% capture about %}
Gaphor is a UML modeling application written in Python. It is designed
to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a
fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture
drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects
of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.
