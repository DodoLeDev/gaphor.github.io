<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Gaphor!</p>
<p>Gaphor is a UML modeling application written in Python. It is designed
to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a
fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture
drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects
of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.</p>
<p>Gaphor is designed around the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Simplicity</em> The application should be easy to use. Only some basic knowledge
of UML is required.</li>
<li><em>Consistency</em> UML is a graphical modeling language, so all information you put
in the model is visible in the diagrams. For example, stereotypes are modeled
in diagrams.</li>
<li><em>Workability</em> The application should not bother the user every time they do
something non-UML-ish.</li>
<li><em>Extensibility</em> Gaphor is built in Python and can be extended easily via "entry points".</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="working-with-gaphor"></a></p>
<h1>Working with Gaphor</h1>
<p>Once Gaphor is launched, it provides you an almost empty user interface.
A new model is already created and the diagram is opened.</p>
<p>The layout of the Gaphor interface is divided into four sections,
namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Diagrams</li>
<li>Diagram Element Toolbox</li>
<li>Properties pane</li>
</ul>
<p>Each section has its own specific function.</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>The navigation section of the interface displays a hierarchical view of
your model. Every model element you create will be inserted into the
navigation section. This view acts as a tree where you can expand and
collapse different elements of your model. This provides an easy way to
view the elements of your model from an elided perspective. That is, you
can collapse those model elements that are irrelevant to the task at
hand.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://www.gaphor.org/pages/gaphor-treeview.png"></p>
<p>In the figure above, you will see that there are three elements in
the navigation view. The root element, <em>New Model</em> is a package. Notice
the small arrow beside <em>New Model</em> that is pointing downward. This
indicates that the element is expanded. You will also notice the two
sub-elements are slightly indented in relation to <em>New Model</em>. The
<em>NewClass</em> element is a class and the <em>main</em> element is a diagram.</p>
<p>In the navigation view, you can also right-click the model elements to
get a context menu. This context menu allows you to delete model
elements, and to refresh the navigation view.</p>
<p>Double clicking on a diagram element will open it in the Diagram
section. Elements such as classes and packages can be dragged from the
tree view on the diagrams.</p>
<h2>Diagram Section</h2>
<p>The diagram section takes up the most space. Multiple diagrams can be
opened at once: they are shown in tabs. Tabs can be closed from the file
menu (Close) and by pressing <code>Ctrl+w</code>.</p>
<p>Most elements have hot zones, shown as gray rectangles that are only
visible when the item is selected. Double clicking on those rectangles
allows you to directly edit the item. E.g. change its name.</p>
<p>Changes you make can be undone by pressing <code>Ctrl+z</code>. To re-do a change, hit
<code>Ctrl+Shift+z</code>.</p>
<h2>Toolbox</h2>
<p>The toolbox is mainly used to add new items to a diagram. Select
the element you want to add by clicking on it. When you click on the
diagram, the selected element is created. The arrow is selected again,
so the element can be manipulated.</p>
<p>Tools can be selected by simply clicking on them. By default the pointer
tool is selected after every item placement. This can be changed by
disabling the "Reset tool" option in the Preferences window. Tools can
also be selected by a keyboard shortcut. The actual character is displayed
as part of the tooltip. Finally it is also possible to drag elements on the
canvas from the toolbox.</p>
<h2>Element Editor</h2>
<p>The Element editor can be unfolded by pressing the pensil button. This will reveal a
utility window that shows all characteristics of the selected element.
Things like name, attributes and stereotypes. It can be opened with
<code>Ctrl+e</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://www.gaphor.org/pages/elementeditor.png"></p>
<p>The properties shown depend on the element that is selected.</p>
<p><a name="your-first-model"></a></p>
<h1>Your first model</h1>
<p>Once Gaphor is started a new empty model is automatically created. The
main diagram is already open in the Diagram section.</p>
<p>Select an element you want to place (e.g. a class) by clicking on the icon in
the Toolbox and click on the diagram. This will place a new Class item instance
on the diagram and add a new Class to the model (it shows up in the Navigation.
The selected tool will reset itself to the Pointer tool after the element is placed
on the diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://www.gaphor.org/pages/oneclass.png"></p>
<p>It's simple to add elements to a diagram.</p>
<p>Some elements are not directly visible. The section in the toolbox is
collapsed and needs to be clicked first to reveal its contents.</p>
<p>Gaphor does not make any assumptions about which elements should be
placed on a diagram. A diagram is a diagram. UML defines all different
kinds of diagrams, such as Class diagrams, Component diagrams, Action
diagrams, Sequence diagrams. But Gaphor does not place any restrictions.</p>
<h2>Creating New Diagrams</h2>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://www.gaphor.org/pages/navpopup.png"></p>
<p>To create a new diagram, use the Navigation section. Select an element that can
contain a diagram (a Package or Profile) and right-click. Select New diagram
and a new diagram is created. As of Gaphor 1.1.0 a buttion is available in the
header bar. Select a package and you'll notice the button is not grayed out and
can be clicked, resulting in a new diagram being added to the model.</p>
<h2>Copy and Paste</h2>
<p>Items in a diagram can be copied and pasted (in the same diagram or
another). A paste will create new items in the diagrams, the items they
represent (e.g. the Class that's shown in the Navigation) is <em>not</em>
copied (call it a shallow copy if you like).</p>
<p>This way you can easely create visual copies of the same (underlaying) model element.</p>
<h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
<p>Adding an existing element to a diagram is simple: drag the element from
the Navigation section onto a diagram. Not all elements that show up in
the Navigation can be added: Diagrams and attribute/operations of a
Class can not be added.</p>
<p>Elements can also be dragged within the Navigation section. This way
classes and packages can be rearranged for example.</p>
<p><a name="extending-models"></a></p>
<h1>Extending models</h1>
<p>Note: this is a more advanced topic!</p>
<p>The UML method to extend UML (basic) components with a special meaning
is by using stereotypes. A stereotype defines a special usage of a model
element. For example: a class that's used as a controller can be
assigned a stereotype "controller". Stereotypes are always enclosed
in guilemets: <code>«</code> and <code>»</code>.</p>
<p>Creating a stereotype starts by the creation of a Profile normally.
Although stereotypes can be created in every package, it's a good habit
to use Profiles for that. Next a Metaclass has to be created. The
metaclass will tell the stereotype on which kind of elements it is
applicable. A Stereotype can be connected to the Metaclass by means of
an Extension relationship.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://www.gaphor.org/pages/simplestereotype.png"></p>
<p>Stereotypes can be applied to basically all elements in a model.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://www.gaphor.org/pages/stereotypedclass.png"></p>
<p>Stereotypes can contain attributes, as shown in the diagram above. Those
attributes can be filled in the Element Editor. This allows for enormous
flexibility. In most cases, especially if some sort of program logic has
to be generated from the models, it is very handy to define special
behaviours to classes and other elements by means of stereotypes.</p>
